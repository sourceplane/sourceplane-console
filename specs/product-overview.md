# SaaS Starter Product Overview

Status: Normative

## Goal

Build Sourceplane as a reusable multi-tenant SaaS starter bootstrap. The starter must let a team launch a Supabase-console-like product surface with organizations, projects, membership, billing, auditability, usage, API access, notifications, webhooks, and an admin/support back office without redesigning the platform foundation.

## Product Shape

The canonical hierarchy is:

```text
User
  -> Organization
       -> Project
            -> Environment
                 -> Project-scoped resources, settings, keys, webhooks, and usage
```

- Organization is the tenant, ownership, membership, audit, and billing boundary.
- Project is the operational boundary where product work happens.
- Environment is an optional deployment/configuration boundary inside a project.
- Project-scoped resources are starter extension points. They must not be required for the basic SaaS bootstrap flows to work.

## Required Starter Capabilities

MUST ship as first-class starter modules:

- authentication and account settings
- organization creation and settings
- membership and invitations
- roles and permissions
- project creation and project settings
- environment management where the product needs environment separation
- billing customers, plans, subscriptions, invoices, and entitlements
- usage metering, quota checks, and usage summaries
- audit log and security-event history
- API keys and service principals
- outgoing webhooks
- notifications and delivery preferences
- admin/support console with audited support actions
- config, secrets, feature flags, and security settings

SHOULD support after the core bootstrap is stable:

- SSO/SAML
- SCIM
- project templates
- team-level or group permissions
- customer support impersonation with explicit audit trail
- quota enforcement before expensive actions
- integration marketplace primitives

MAY support later:

- per-project billing
- enterprise contracts
- usage-based overage billing
- product-specific runtime orchestration
- managed project resources driven by component manifests

## Non-Goals

V1 is not:

- a generic Kubernetes or infrastructure orchestration platform
- a replacement for GitHub Actions or other workflow engines
- a user-authored policy DSL
- a marketplace platform
- a full customer data warehouse
- a Supabase Auth wrapper unless a future spec explicitly changes identity ownership

## Platform Baseline

- Cloudflare is the V1 compute, ingress, async, cache, and hosting platform.
- Supabase Postgres is the primary relational database for product-owned state.
- Workers reach Supabase Postgres through Hyperdrive at repository-adapter boundaries.
- D1 may be used for tests, edge-local caches, or customer-managed resources, but not as the source of truth for starter domain state.
- Queues, Workflows, Durable Objects, R2, KV, Secrets Store, and Analytics Engine are implementation adapters behind domain contracts.

## UX Baseline

The web console must open directly into the usable SaaS application. A user should be able to:

- sign in
- create an organization
- invite a member
- accept an invitation
- switch organizations
- create a project
- manage project settings and environments
- create or revoke API keys
- inspect audit history
- review usage and billing
- configure webhooks and notification preferences

The CLI and SDK must expose the same public contracts for automation.

## Agent Execution Model

Specs are written for human review and agent execution. Work should be split into PR-sized task loops:

- orchestrator creates or updates the task and verification plan
- task agent implements only the scoped change
- verifier runs the stated checks
- failed verification produces a fix task, not new feature scope
- decisions and spec changes are recorded before downstream implementation depends on them

Every task should define intent, non-goals, affected files, acceptance criteria, verification, and expected repo state.
